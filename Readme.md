This project aims to replicate Samsung Health UI as genuine as possible while staying as much as possible in the shared code, it's using the following packages:
- [dotnet/System.Graphics](https://github.com/dotnet/System.Graphics)
- Some classe from [dotnet/GraphicsControls](https://github.com/dotnet/GraphicsControls)
- [Xamanimation](https://github.com/jsuarezruiz/Xamanimation)
- [Xamarin/Xamarin.CommunityToolkit](https://github.com/Xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit) of cource :)
